//
//  Pipes allow for one-way communication between two processes in the form of a stream of data bytes.  They often
//  have a fixed memory size.  Reading from a pipe usually "blocks" (or "waits") until the requested number of bytes
//  is available.  Writing to a pipe usually blocks when there is not enough room in the pipe to write the data.  Once
//  a process reads data from the pipe, that data is removed, which leaves more room in the pipe to write more data.
//
//  Since data is read from pipes in the same order it was put in (i.e. the first byte written is the first byte read),
//  they are often referred to as a FIFO (or fifo), which stands for First-In-First-Out.
//
//  Just like for shared memory, we need to give our pipe a text-based name so processes can connect to it.  If the pipe
//  already exists, we will just connect to the existing one.  Otherwise, a new pipe is created.  The pipe also has a
//  persistence associated with it...
//      Windows: the pipe will exist until all references to it are removed
//      Linux/OSX: the pipe will exist until the machine is rebooted (kernel persistence)
//  On POSIX systems, we also have the option to "unlink" the name from the memory, meaning that further attempts to
//  connect to the named resource will create a new, independent pipe.  The old one will be freed when all existing
//  references to it are removed.
//
//  Note that "true" pipes often block (or wait) until there is a connection on both the read-end and the write-end of
//  the pipe.  For portability and ease-of-use, we have created a pseudo-pipe in the file
//      cpen333/process/pipe.h
//  which is created using a circular buffer and a shared memory block.  This version does not block.
