//  Let's say we want to have 100 processes communicate over a two-way channel
//  with a central process using pipes.  We could accomplish this with 200 named
//  pipes, each one a one-way channel to or from the central process.  This approach
//  doesn't scale well however: the more processes, the more pipe names we will need,
//  and it may start getting hard to keep track of them.  If we want other processes
//  to join dynamically, we may not even know how many pipes we need beforehand.
//
//  Windows named pipes work a bit differently compared to our simple FIFO: they are
//  bi-directionaly communication channels (i.e. two-way) and use a
//  client-server model:
//    - The "pipe server" waits, listening for an incoming connection
//    - When a client connects, a two-way pipe is established
//    - The pipe server is then free to create a second pipe with the same name and
//      wait for a new connection
//  This allows multiple pipes to connect to the server using the same name,
//  and all these pipes can be communicating simultaneously.
//
//  In the course library, we mimick this behaviour on POSIX systems by establishing
//  a single named pipe between the server and a client, unlinking the name so it can be
//  reused, then have the server create a new pipe with the same name to wait for the
//  next connection.

//  This method will be spun-off into a thread to handle communication with a client
//  NOTE: notice the && symbol on the input pipe.  This signals a "move" operator.
//        Pipes have important internal information which cannot be duplicated.
//        Otherwise, we may introduce race conditions of two pipes trying to read/write
//        to the same end of the pipe, and one may inadvertently close the pipe while
//        the other is still using it.  This prevents us from using regular assignments like
//              cpen333::process::pipe new_pipe = other_pipe;
//        We *could* pass the pipe by reference, but that would mean that the server
//        would need to keep a copy in a vector or array to ensure the pipe still
//        exists while we are communicating.
//
//        The alternative is to pass the entire pipe over to this method, including
//        ownership of it.  This is one of the purposes of the move operator.
//              cpen333::process::pipe new_pipe = std::move(other_pipe);
//        When we do this, the contents of other_pipe are "moved" to new_pipe.  The
//        other_pipe is then in an indeterminate state and should be discarded.
