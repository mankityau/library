//  Semaphores are counting objects that represent a certain number of "resources", and allow processes to wait until
//  one of the resources is available.  To acquire a resource, you need to wait() on it, which will block until
//  the semaphore's count > 0.  Once the thread passes through, it will safely decrement the count.
//  To release the resource for others to use, you notify() the semaphore, which will increase its internal count.
//
//  Some semaphores allow you to specify a maximum count, so that calling notify() many times will only increase
//  the internal count up to the maximum value.  The ones used here do not have this property, though you can easily
//  create your own using a shared "count" variable.
