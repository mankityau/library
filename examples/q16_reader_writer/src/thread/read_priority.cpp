//  Data that is unchanging does not need to be protected using a mutex.  But what if data only changes "occasionally"?
//  That is, what if you end up reading from a set of data a lot more often that writing to it?  Multiple readers
//  who promise not to try to modify the data should be able to read the data at the same time.
//
//  This is the purpose of "shared" mutexes.  When locked in "shared" mode, anyone who promises not to modify the
//  data can be granted access at the same time.  When someone wants to write to the data, they need to request
//  access and lock the mutex in "exclusive" mode, allowing only one thread to access the data.
//
//  The details of shared mutexes can be tricky, but in general there are three priority modes:
//      read_priority: if readers are currently reading in shared mode, any new reader will be granted access,
//                     writers will then be locked out until there are no more readers.  This may lead to writer
//                     starvation.
//      write_priority: once exclusive access is requested, all further readers are blocked out until all writers
//                      have finished their jobs.  This might be important if there will be very many readers, and only
//                      a few writers.  However, if there are many writers, then this can starve out the readers.
//      fair_priority:  readers and writers will share priority, usually based on some kind of alternation scheme.
