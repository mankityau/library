//  Sockets allow for two-way communication over a network.  Like pipes, sockets
//  use a client-server model so that multiple sockets can be established with the same
//  server.
//
//  The server listens for connections at a certain network address on a certain "port".  The port
//  is like an apartment unit number at an address.  It is reminiscent of large telephone switch-boards
//  that used to have physical ports to connect callers, the socket port is used to connect the
//  two processes, allowing them to establish a communication channel.
//
//  In this chat program we demonstrate a very simple communication API.  Before each message, we send
//  a command to the server to indicate what type of message it is.


//  This method will be spun-off into a thread to handle communication with a client
//  NOTE: notice the && symbol on the input pipe.  This signals a "move" operator.
//        Sockets have important internal information which cannot be duplicated.
//        Otherwise, we may introduce race conditions of two sockets trying to read/write
//        to the same end of the channel, and one may inadvertently close the socket while
//        the other is still using it.  This prevents us from using regular assignments like
//              cpen333::process::socket new_socket = other_socket;
//        We *could* pass the socket by reference, but that would mean that the server
//        would need to keep a copy in a vector or array to ensure the socket still
//        exists while we are communicating.
//
//        The alternative is to pass the entire socket over to this method, including
//        ownership of it.  This is one of the purposes of the move operator.
//              cpen333::process::socket new_socket = std::move(other_socket);
//        When we do this, the contents of other_socket are "moved" to new_socket.  The
//        other_socket is then in an indeterminate state and should be discarded.
