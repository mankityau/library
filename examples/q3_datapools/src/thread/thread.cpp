//  Datapools (a.k.a Shared Memory, or Mapped Memory) are simply blocks of shared memory accessible by multiple
//  threads/processes.  Since threads within a single process all share memory anyways, we can just use either
//  a shared object, or a global variable
//
//  There is a subtlety: the shared data block should be contiguous and completely self-contained.  This means we
//  can't store regular object pointers within the pool, since those will inevitably refer to memory outside of the
//  pool itself.  While this may not be an issue for threads which would also share that outside memory and address
//  space, it becomes a really big issue for processes, which don't.  From the perspective of a different process,
//  that pointer-based memory address may be invalid, or refer to some other completely unrelated block of memory.
//
//  Even more subtlety: we also need to avoid containers, and other classes which internally may store data on the
//  heap.  This includes strings, vectors, maps, etc...
//

// Layout of block of shared memory stored within a struct
// Since all members are fixed-length basic types, this is a self-contained contiguous block of memory.  In C++, the
// memory layout is gauranteed, with members arranged in order [ 20 chars, 1 long, 1 double ].  The actual number of
// bytes may change from system to system, but the addresses can be computed using the sizeof() operator
